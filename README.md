# HyprDebian
Simple setup script for installation Hyprland On Debian(sid)

I love you very much Debian and works Vaxerski, so I decided to write a simple script (really very simple), which collects all the components from the source code Hyprland. 

The script always collects the latest versions of dependencies and the most Hyprland, which in theory could cause failures during a global update of any of the components.

It is recommended to set it to CLEAN debian sid And yes, debian sid more stable, more comfortable and safer than the same testing

Okay, I wrote a lot. Let's get started with the installation.

wget https://github.com/ritascarlet/HyprDebian/blob/main/HyprDebian.sh

chmod +x HyprDebian.sh

sudo ./HyprDebian.sh
